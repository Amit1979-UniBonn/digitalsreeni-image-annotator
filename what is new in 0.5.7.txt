What's New in Version 0.5.7 (Compared to 0.5.6)

Image Augmenter Tool Enhancements:

The tool now supports augmentation of both images and their corresponding annotations (COCO JSON format). Users can load a directory containing images and a COCO JSON annotation file, apply various transformations, and export the augmented dataset. The augmented images and annotations are stored in a designated directory.

Bug Fixes:

Histogram Equalization: Now works correctly on 16-bit images. Previously, the application would crash when processing these images.
SAM-Assisted Annotation: Supports 16-bit PNG images, which previously caused crashes. It continues to work with 16-bit TIFF and other formats.
Save Project Window: Fixed an issue where the application would crash if the user opened the "Save Project" window, exited without saving, and then attempted to save the project again.
Project Save with Imported Annotations: Resolved a bug where the project would crash if saved without an "images" sub-directory. Now, the application automatically copies images to a new "images" sub-directory after user confirmation.
Project Name Display: Fixed an issue where the project name would not display in the top menu when saved with imported JSON annotations. This is now resolved.
