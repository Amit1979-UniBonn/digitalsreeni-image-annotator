New Features and Enhancements

- Improved SAM (Segment Anything Model) integration by moving related code into a separate module, reducing clutter in the main application.
- Updated the user interface to better highlight annotated slices within the slice list.
- Added a "Save As" option to the Project menu, with the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + S. The shortcut for "Annotation Statistics" has been reassigned to Ctrl + Alt + S (previously Ctrl + Shift + S).
- Added a hidden game for those moments of downtime. The fun part is figuring out which key starts it! 

Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue where clicking "OK" while adding a new class would be accepted but no action was taken. Now, the user is prompted to either enter a class name or cancel the action.
- Fixed a bug where, during SAM-Assisted annotation, pressing the Escape key would incorrectly disable the SAM tool. The tool now remains active, allowing users to continue drawing regions. Pressing Enter accepts the region, and pressing Escape rejects it without disabling the tool.
- Addressed an issue where an annotation in edit mode would remain visible on a switched image. Now, when switching images, the annotation exits edit mode and does not appear on the new image.
