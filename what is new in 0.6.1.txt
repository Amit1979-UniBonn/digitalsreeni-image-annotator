New Features and Enhancements

- Paint Brush and Eraser Tools for Annotations: A valuable addition, especially when SAM-Assisted annotations either under or over-annotate objects. Use the paint brush tool (or polygon) to fill in under-annotated areas, and then merge with existing annotations using the Merge tool. For over-annotated regions, the eraser tool can be used to remove excess. Adjust brush size with the - and = keys. 
Note: Erasing a large annotation through its center splits it into two separate annotations, each saved individually.

- Autosave Functionality: Autosave is now triggered after key actions such as adding or deleting images, classes, annotations, or editing class names, colors, or merging annotations. While the application is designed to handle errors smoothly and prompt users when necessary, in the rare event of an unexpected bug, your work will be automatically saved.

Bug Fixes

- SAM-Assisted Annotation Selection: Clicking SAM-Assisted without selecting a model no longer crashes the app. It now prompts you to choose a model.

- Squashed numerous bugs that popped up during the development of new features.
