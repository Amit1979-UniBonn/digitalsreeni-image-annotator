# New Features and Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Annotation Management**
   - Easily change the class of existing annotations
   - Toggle visibility of classes for clearer visualization

2. **YOLO Integration (Beta)**
   - Train YOLO models using current annotations
   - Load trained models to automatically segment images
   - Convert segmentations to annotations (single images only, not available for slices or stacks)
   - Selectively accept or reject class predictions

3. **Improved YOLO Compatibility**
   - Updated YOLO export and import to align with YOLOv11 structure
   - New project directory layout: data.yaml file, train and valid directories (each containing images and labels subdirectories)

4. **Advanced Annotation Analysis**
   - View area measurements for annotations, displayed next to annotation names
   - Sort annotations by name/number or area for better organization

# Bug Fixes and Known Issues

- **Linux Compatibility**: The application may have limited functionality on Linux systems. Further testing is required.
- **YOLO Model Loading**: Resolved a crash issue when loading YOLO models with mismatched classes. The application now provides a user-friendly mismatch notification.
- Various other minor bugs have been addressed to enhance overall stability and user experience.
- Known issue: Canceling a YOLO model training does not stop the training.
